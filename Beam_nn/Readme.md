## Beam displacement predicting neuralnetwork


This neuralnetwork model is meant to predict displacement of a beam element


Python verison: 3.7.9 (Might work with other versions too)

Needed packages:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. Pandas
4. clamped_beam* (which you can grab from this repo)
6. keras
7. tensorflow
