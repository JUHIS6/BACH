# BACH

This repo is used for my bachelors thesis. You can now find two different model examples of using neuralnetworks on mechanical systems. One shows an example on spring-mass-damper system and other on beam displacement when force is applied.

Main components of these models:

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Keras
3. Tensorflow

Python 3.7.9 is being used in all files
