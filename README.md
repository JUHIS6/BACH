This repo is used for my bachelors thesis. You can now find two different system examples of using neuralnetworks on mechanical systems. One shows an example on mass-spring-damper system and other on beam displacement when force is applied.

Main components of this repository:

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Keras
3. Tensorflow

Python 3.7.9 is being used in all files

### Packackes you need (atleast)

- Tensorflow (2.3.0 version used)
- keras (2.4.3 version used)
- Matplotlib (3.5.0 version used)
- Numpy (1.20.3 version used)
- Pandas (1.3.5 version used)

+ ofc other packages that these need
